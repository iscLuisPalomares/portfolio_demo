                  <strong>Currently working at HP Tijuana.</strong> I have developed a custom framework to enable SQA team to run 
                  tests in an easier way, bringing automation to features needed to test in a Real Time Communication (RTC) app is what I do. 
                  Using flutter and dart technology to set the automation and then with Angular bring a UI so users can get 
                  a better glance of what has been running and they can edit tests to stick to their needs.
                  <br>
                  I brought a server to enable SDK integration testing, using Node js along with WebSockets integration testing has become easier.
                  <br>
                  <strong>Cardinal Health Tijuana</strong> I deployed a Software development pipeline to improve our applications delivery 
                  process and also developed systems for production monitoring and CAPA support for several plants across Mexico and Costa Rica; 
                  also developed scripts to automate tasks done at ERP.
                  <br>
                  <strong>TLC Asociados</strong> I helped the company to level up their processes by improving the clients scoring system 
                  according to different Anexos and Laws they have to comply with. Also enhanced calculations for Anexo31 and Anexo24 and 
                  created solutions to automate the loads and calculations of different Custom Brokers into their system so they can show 
                  clients their results in a web app.
